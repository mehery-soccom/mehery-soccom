# Building Smarter AI Apps with SCRIPTUS: 

## How Business Users Can Now Customize OpenAI Prompts  

Before you continue read **"Custom Options"**, a feature that allows business users to update key settings in SCRIPTUS without needing a developer. This eliminated the need for constant back-and-forth when making small changes, empowering teams to take control of their scripts.  

Now, weâ€™re taking this a step furtherâ€”**enabling businesses to configure OpenAI (ChatGPT) prompts** directly in SCRIPTUS. This means that if your app uses ChatGPT for automation, support, or content generation, you no longer need a developer to tweak and refine AI behavior.  

With **"Custom Options for AI prompts"**, business users can now update how the AI interacts, responds, and processes informationâ€”on the fly.

## Why Do Prompts Matter When Using AI?

When integrating OpenAI into an application, prompts define how the AI understands and responds to user interactions. A well-crafted prompt ensures the AI gives relevant, useful, and accurate responses.  

Different prompts are used for different purposes:  
âœ… **Intent Prompt** â€“ Helps the AI determine what the user is asking.  
âœ… **Summary Prompt** â€“ Allows the AI to summarize a conversation or data.  
âœ… **Tone & Style Prompts** â€“ Adjusts how the AI communicates (formal, casual, humorous, etc.).  
âœ… **Instructional Prompts** â€“ Tells the AI how to behave in a specific situation.  

Previously, changing these prompts meant **editing code**, requiring a developerâ€™s involvement. Now, with SCRIPTUS, business users can configure these prompts themselvesâ€”without touching a single line of code!

## How It Works in SCRIPTUS

1. **Developer Creates the AI-Powered Script**  
   - A developer writes a script in SCRIPTUS that uses OpenAIâ€™s API to process user messages.  
   - Instead of fixing the prompt inside the script, they define a **Custom Option** for it.  

2. **Business User Updates the Prompts Anytime**  
   - In the SCRIPTUS Web UI, the business team can modify prompts in real-time.  
   - No need to wait for developersâ€”just update the text and save changes.  

3. **AI Behavior Instantly Adapts**  
   - As soon as a new prompt is entered, the AI responds according to the latest business needs.  
   - No app updates, no downtime, just instant customization!

## Example: AI-Powered Customer Support Bot 

Imagine youâ€™re running a customer support chatbot powered by OpenAI. The chatbot answers customer inquiries, determines intent, and provides relevant responses.  

### ðŸš€ Before Custom Options for Prompts:
Your chatbot script contains a fixed intent prompt like this:  
ðŸ’¬ *"Analyze the user message and determine if it's a product inquiry, complaint, or general question."*  

If you want to refine thisâ€”maybe adding "refund requests" as a new categoryâ€”you must call a developer.  

### ðŸ˜© Problem:
- Small changes require technical support.  
- AI behavior is rigid and not easily adaptable.  
- Updating the bot takes unnecessary time and effort.  

### âœ… After Introducing Custom Options for Prompts: 
Now, the intent prompt is a configurable option in SCRIPTUS. A business user can log in and modify it:  

ðŸ’¬ *"Analyze the user message and determine if it's a product inquiry, complaint, refund request, or general question."*  

### ðŸŽ‰ Result:
- The chatbot **immediately** starts recognizing refund-related queries.  
- No developer involvement needed.  
- The business adapts to customer needs instantly.
