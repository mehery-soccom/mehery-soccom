# Custom Options

## Introduction
"Custom Options" are like smart, customizable controls built into scripts. Instead of hard-coding specific values (like age limits, message templates, or URLs), developers now create flexible variables that business users can update directly through a simple, user-friendly web interface—no coding required.

Think of it as a switchboard for your scripts: you can adjust settings, inputs, or conditions whenever your business needs change, without having to rely on a developer to edit the code for you.


## How Does It Work for You?

Here’s how the process becomes effortless with "Custom Options":

1. Developer Sets It Up Once: A developer writes a script that handles your inbound messages (for example, a chatbot response). Instead of fixing values in the script, they create adjustable options—like setting an "age limit" or choosing a "welcome message."

2. You Take Over: These adjustable options are displayed in a clean, easy-to-use interface. From here, you can make updates yourself in just a few clicks—without needing to contact a developer.

3. Instant Updates: The changes you make are instantly reflected in how your script operates. No waiting, no back-and-forth emails with the tech team!


## Example Use Case: Automating Customer Onboarding
Let’s imagine you’re running a subscription-based service and using SCRIPTUS to automate customer onboarding messages.

- Without Custom Options: Your developer writes a script that sends a welcome message to new users. If you want to change the message—say, for a holiday promotion—you have to ask the developer to edit the script. This might take days, especially if they’re busy.

- With Custom Options: Your developer sets up a "welcomeMessage" option for you. Now, you can log into the SCRIPTUS platform, go to the "Custom Options" section, and update the welcome message yourself. For example:

    - Original: "Welcome to our service!" 
    - Updated for promotion: "Happy New Year! Welcome to our service—enjoy 20% off your first month!"

No need to contact anyone, and the change is live in minutes.

## Other Real-Life Scenarios Where Custom Options Shine

1. Dynamic Discounts:
Let’s say your script offers a discount to customers based on a spending threshold. You can use a "Custom Option" to adjust this threshold depending on your ongoing promotions, such as increasing it from $50 to $75 during a sale.

2. Event Registrations:
Hosting a webinar? Your script can include a "registrationURL" that directs users to sign up. With "Custom Options," you can update the URL to point to a new event without any developer involvement.

3. Validation Rules:
For compliance or internal policies, you may need to enforce rules—such as an age limit for registrations. With "Custom Options," you can adjust the age requirement as needed (e.g., from 18 to 21), making compliance effortless.


## Why?
- Speed: Changes that used to take days can now be made instantly by your team.
- Independence: You no longer have to depend on a developer for every small adjustment.
- Flexibility: Adapt scripts to your needs as they evolve, without waiting for technical help.
- Efficiency: Save time and reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary back-and-forth between teams.
